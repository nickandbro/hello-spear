Name: Nick Brooks
Why I want to join Spear:
I am passionate about Spear AI's mission getting AI into the hands of operators and closing the gap between AI technology and real world use cases. After working on some large scale deployments of GenAI in the Air Force, I think Spear AI focus on applying AI to submarine acoustic data feels like a natural continuation of that work, but at a much more impactful scale. One thing I am excited to do while as a SkillBridge intern is deepening my experience with Rust, as it can vastly increase the performance of performance-critical systems.
