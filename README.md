## Why I Want to Join Spear

I am passionate about Spear AI's mission of getting AI into the hands of operators and closing the gap between AI technology and real-world use cases. After working on some large-scale deployments of GenAI in the Air Force, I think Spear AI's focus on applying AI to submarine acoustic data feels like a natural continuation of that work—but at a much more impactful scale.

One thing I'm excited to do as a SkillBridge intern is deepen my experience with Rust, as it can vastly increase the performance of performance-critical systems.

## Learning Goals

- Strengthen my knowledge of Rust
- Obtain AWS Developer Associate Certification
- Develop a portfolio project showcasing my skillset
